        <h1>GAS STRAND</h1>
        <h5>GENERAL ACADEMIC STRAND &#40;GAS&#41;</h5>
        <p> is a flexible academic track in the K-12 curriculum that allows students to explore a wide range of subjects without focusing on a specific field like STEM,
             HUMSS, or ABM. It is designed for students who are undecided about their future career path or want a broad knowledge base that can be applied to 
             various disciplines. The GAS strand provides a combination of subjects from other academic tracks, making it versatile and ideal for those who want flexibility in choosing 
             their college course or career.
